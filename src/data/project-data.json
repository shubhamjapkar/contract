At its core is D, son of an exiled priest and a secret assassin, born with the legacy of Halahal—the ultimate poison. Unlike Raavan, who drew power from divine nectar, D transforms destruction itself into strength. First hailed as a visionary bridging science, mysticism, and philosophy, he seeks to build a utopia free of suffering. But his pursuit of absolute order edges into tyranny, blurring the line between savior and conqueror. Shaped by his father’s restraint and his mother’s ambition, D’s rise sparks a battle over destiny, free will, and the future of humanity—where salvation and annihilation are two sides of the same truth.",
